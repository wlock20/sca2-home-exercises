Ahh... The internet.

Yes... But what makes up all the amazing pages we know and love? **HTML**.

**HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language. If you have every heard of hyperlinks in word docs, this usage of hyper may make some sense. What HyperText in **HTML** means it's a language that ultimate links content (text) together! Basically, **HTML** constructs the skeleton of a website; a title should go here, some text should go here, an image here, etc. In fact, what you're looking at right now is... (drumroll)... **HTML**!

There are so many different tags in **HTML** that dictate what will be on a user's screen. However, if you've ever seen a website that is pure HTML...

It's pretty spartan. We can make our pages more interesting and visually appealing by styling them! Guess what, there's a language for that too! It's called **CSS**.

### CSS

**CSS** stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a fancy way of describing the way that **CSS** works in a top down flow. Basically, **CSS** styles the **HTML** by assigning style atributes to the different **HTML** tags. No worries about the gritty details of what that means right now, but we'll see soon enough! The result can make websites that look like the very retro [website for Space Jam](https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm) or like the professional [website for NPR](https://www.npr.org/).

### Resources

It turns out, one of the best resources for trying to figure out how to make webpages is the internet! For **HTML/CSS**, I suggest using [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). You can find info on all kinds of **HTML** tags and how to use them, as well as what styling options exist for **CSS**!

## Your Mission

Create a static website using HTML and CSS.

You can add new pages by creating new HTML files in the `views` folder and then adding new route handlers to `index.js`. For example, if you create a new `about.html` page that a user can access via the `/about` path, you'll want to add the following route handler:

```
app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile("about.html", { root: views })
})
```

## Specification

Your website must include the following elements:

1. At least four separate pages
2. At least three images using the `<img/>` tag
3. A Navigation bar where you can access every page
4. At least one `<div/>` that has either an `id` or `class`
5. Two different font sizes
6. At least one heading (`h1`, `h2`, etc.)
7. At least four `<a/>` tag linking to another site (using `href`)
8. At least one ordered or unordered list (`<ol>` or `<ul>`) with several list items (`<li>`)
9. Style in a separate `styles.css` file

Feel free to add more to this website! These are just minimum requirements.

If unsure about what to make, here are some possibilities:

- A webpage dedicated to your favorite celebrity, sports team, or musical artist
- A webpage introducting yourself to the world
- A webpage dedicated to a hobby of yours

## Testing

You can run your web server by running `npm run start` and accessing `localhost:3000` in your browser to view your homepage (`index.html`).

## Submission

Be sure you're in the day3 directory and add, commit, and push all your changes to your files using git (Remember how?).
